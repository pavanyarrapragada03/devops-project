# DevOps Project with Git

This project demonstrates a standard Git workflow for managing a simple project, following common DevOps best practices.

## Features

- **Version Control**: Managed with Git and hosted on GitHub.
- **Branching Strategy**: Utilizes a `main`, `dev`, and `feature` branch model to separate stable code from development.
- **Pull Requests**: All new features are merged into the `dev` branch via pull requests for code review.
- **Release Management**: Releases are marked with version tags (e.g., `v1.0`) on the `main` branch.
